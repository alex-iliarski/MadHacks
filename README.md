# MadHacks 2023 Project: What's Up Doc
Alex Iliarski, Isaac Berlin, Andrew O'Konski-Magnuson, and Benjamin Lindeen

## Inspiration
The inspiration for What's up Doc was the friction and difficulty that we have all experienced finding a suitable medical care provider with the current resources that exist on the market. We went out to make it easier for patients to find the right doctor, while also providing comprehensive information and filters to help patients make informed decisions.
## What it does
What's up Doc provides a safe and easy search function that allows users to filter doctors by location, specialty, years of experience, language, gender, and insurance accepted. The platform also provides comprehensive doctor profiles, including ratings and reviews from other patients.
## How we built it
We used Google docs and Notability during the planning stage. For our backend, we used Python with the Flask framework to connect to our frontend which was built with HTML, CSS, and the bootstrap framework. We finally used MongoDB for our database, Google Maps for our interactive map, and Twilio for our mobile communication integration.  
## Challenges we ran into
Properly configuring all aspects and languages within the website to work harmoniously. We had specific trouble with Flask, the Google Maps API, and the Twilio integration.   
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of overcoming the aforementioned challenges within one day even when it seemed like things wouldn't come together in time. Through this, we are incredibly pleased to be making it easier for patients to find the right doctor, as well as providing comprehensive doctor profiles and filters to help patients make informed decisions.
## What we learned
We all learned a lot about program development and programming in a team. We all learned invaluable skills in different programming languages frameworks and APIs. 
## What's next for What's Up Doc
While today we have the template for something big, we would love to expand further mostly in the doctors that are on the platform. At this current time, we have placeholder data to represent what a user may see, but we would like this to be as much a service for the end user as it would be for the doctors that are on the platform. We envision having an account and portal system for doctors to enter in their information to create a comprehensive and succinct profile, that will allow their potential customers to connect with their hard work and dedication.
